# Sometimes we need to be informed when certain things happen:
#   - Object's property changes
#   - Object does something
#   - Some external event occurs (external from the system you code)

# We want to listen to events and be notified when they occur
#   - Notifications should include useful data

# We want to unsubscribe from events we are not interested anymore

# An OBSERVER is an object that wishes to be informed about events
# happening in the system. The entity generating the events is an
# observable.
