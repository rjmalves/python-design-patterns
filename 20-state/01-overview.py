# Consider an ordinary telephone.
# Whay you do with it depends on the state of the phone/line
#   - If it's ringing or you want to make a call, you can pick it up
#   - Phone must be off the hook to talk/make a call
#   - If you try calling someone, and it's busy, you put the handset down
# Changes in state in state can be explicit or in response to some event (Observer Pattern)

# The State Pattern is a pattern in which the object's behavior is determined by its state.
# An object transitions from one state to another (something to trigger a transition)

# A formalized construct which manages state and transitions is called a state machine
